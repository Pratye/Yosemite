# Yosemite - AI-Driven Consumer Insights Platform

Welcome to **Yosemite**, an AI-powered platform designed to help consumers make informed choices by providing real-time insights on food products. This project was developed as part of the **ConsumeWise** challenge for the **Gen AI Exchange Hackathon by Google**. 

## üåê Live Demo
Check out the live application at: [www.thirdeye.website](http://www.thirdeye.website)
<br> Wait for a few seconds for the server to start. It is hosted on Google Cloud Run.</br>

## üöÄ Project Overview
Yosemite is an AI-enabled smart platform that:
- Automatically collects data from food product labels using **OCR (Google Document AI)** and **LangChain** for web scraping.
- Extracts and analyzes key nutritional data, ingredients, proprietary claims (e.g., sugar-free, trans fat-free), and other relevant information.
- Leverages multiple **open-source food databases** like **Open Food Facts** and **FoodData Central** to provide accurate, comprehensive data.
- Uses **GenAI** to perform health analysis, validate product claims, and generate personalized nudges for consumers based on their dietary preferences.
- Ensures a scalable, low-latency experience by utilizing **Google Cloud Run GPU** for real-time processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Data Scraping**: Extracts information from food labels, websites, and databases.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Organizes, standardizes, and validates the collected data.
- **AI-Powered Health Analysis**: Provides health insights on ingredients, nutritional values, and proprietary claims.
- **Personalized Insights**: Recommends healthier alternatives and alerts users to potential allergens or harmful ingredients.
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Supports data from Open Food Facts, FoodData Central, Edamam Food Database, and more.

## üí° How it Works
1. **Data Collection**: Yosemite scrapes and processes product data from multiple sources using **LangChain** and **OCR** technology.
2. **ETL Pipeline**: The data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into a structured format.
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: The platform uses **GenAI** to analyze the data and provide insights.
4. **User Interaction**: Consumers can interact with the platform through a chatbot interface to get real-time health recommendations and insights.
